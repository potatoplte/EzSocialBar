EzSocialBar
===========

EzSocial Bar is an addon intended to provide a overall easy to read summary of your social status Similar to the social bar in SWTOR. The Add-on sits in the upper right corner of your screen and provides an overview of how many people are online for each from your friends, guild and circles lists.

Feature List:

    Overview of online Friends, Guild members and Circle Members
    Click to open Friends / Guild tabs

    Notifications: When someone comes online / offline from your friends list
    New Friendship Notifications: When someone has added you as either friend, or accounts Friend.
    Friendship status updates
    Click to Open: Circles Tabs

Update v0.8b 8/5/14: Updated Graphics

Useage:

    /ezs lock
    /ezs unlock
    /ezs background - toggles background image on and off
    /ezs sounds - toggles sounds on and off

Note: Notifications have been added, but i have not been able to verify that they work. For some reason I do not get the events from carbine, but other users have reported getting these. If you get a notification, it can be dismissed by click on it.

The Add-on should save the position of the bar when you log off, however there may be errors on carbines side at the moment that stops this, will work on the feature / a fix during OpenBeta.
