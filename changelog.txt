-- Version 0.9a --
[*] Total Overhaul of the UI, you may now choose what is shown and what is not, e.g. circles, friends and guild
[*] Few crashes fixes for notifications
[*] Circles will now only display if you belong to at least one circle, 
	and it will only show the ones you have membership with

Developer Note: There will be bugs, this is still a beta build. The UI is now functioning as i intended it to.
